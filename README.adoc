= ALDSDialer

Pre-dials an Alternate Long Distance Service access number
before them, to save you money!

This uses a Broadcast Receiver to pick up outgoing phone calls and, 
if it is long distance AND you're in an area covered by your chosen
ALDS (Alternate Long Distance Service), changes the number to
(local ALDS) + ",," + (outgoing number).
